//TODO PROJECT OVERVIEW
//5. Banking System with Inheritance
//Concepts covered: Inheritance, polymorphism, classes, and objects.
//Description: Create a banking system where users can create accounts and perform operations like deposit, withdrawal,
//and balance inquiry. Implement inheritance to handle different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
// Use polymorphism to handle operations differently based on account type.
